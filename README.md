## Brief Description

Implementing user login and registration is a fundamental functionality of any backend system. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to configure these functions with any database and have a system that allows distinguishing between your registered users and the users who still need to sign up.

## Basics Functional Requirement

- [x] Create a basic server that, on the first route, says: "Login & Register server".
- [x] Implement a basic user model to interact with.
- [x] Configure the database to store user data.
- [x] Create a login endpoint that implements a local authentication strategy using headers, cookies, local auth, etc.
- [x] Create a register endpoint that implements a local authentication strategy using headers, cookies, local auth, etc.
- [x] Create a route protection middleware that prevents access if the user has not been verified.

## Technical Requirement

1. Include a Java/Spring Boot backend.
2. Everything should be stored in Railway MySQL Database.
3. Include authentication with Spring Security JWT.


## API Routes

You can find all routes information on 
[Fundacion Esplai Hackathon documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/22849326/2s93kxdRwk).
    
   

## Deliverables

1. A working REST API, built by you that runs on a local server.
2. Adequate and complete documentation in the README.md file.
